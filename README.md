# HelloWorld
My first Github
following the guides, I clicked on heloworld, then bracn master, and then README-edits, create branch, hit enter on keyboard, at last I have two braches known as master and readme-edits which is a copy of master, I know that commit captures the history of changes I made, so you as a contributor can understand what I have done and why.
